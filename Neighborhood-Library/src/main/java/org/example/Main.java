/*
It's hard to check a book back in based on its id number when the id number is never shown :P
The check in doesn't seem to work. I tried checking in a book after looking up the id in the array.
So when checking a book in, you have to make certain it is already checked out
if it is checked out, then you switch it to being checked in.
Other than that I like your menus! You do need to be more blatant about what you expect the user to input though
Sometimes I was confused
You did use the while loop and switch cases correctly, but go over your logic. It looks like you did check out logic
for both check in and check out
